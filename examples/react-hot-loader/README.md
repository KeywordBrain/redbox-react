# react-hot-loader example
react-hot-loader 3 ([PR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/pull/240)) is coming soon. This examples shows how to use `redbox-react` with this upcoming version of RHL. Once [ErrorBoundaries](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6020) land in `react`, this approach will also work for capturing and rendering errors on updates (= when hot reloading). For now, this only works on initial mount.
